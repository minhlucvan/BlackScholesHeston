# BlackScolesImpliedVolatility
I've created a Python script that determines that *implied volatility* of a European call option using the bisection method. I mainly want to use it to determine volatility surface plots to include in my bachelor thesis.

It imports data that I downloaded from barchart.com, mainly the maturity, strike and price of a European call option. It then determines the implied volatility and plots it in three-dimensional space.
